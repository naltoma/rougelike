## Critical Problems Summary

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Identified
1. **Step Button Problem**: Alternates between infinite wait and full execution
2. **Pause Button Problem**: Cannot stop continuous execution  
3. **Reset Button Problem**: No functionality implemented

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Solutions
1. **Step Button**: Single click â†’ execute ONE action â†’ pause â†’ accept next interaction
2. **Pause Button**: Click during continuous â†’ execute until NEXT action completes â†’ pause
3. **Reset Button**: Complete system reset (game state, execution controller, session logs)

## Technical Context Summary

### Current System
- **ExecutionController**: Manages PAUSED/STEPPING/CONTINUOUS/COMPLETED modes
- **solve() Function**: Contains Python loops with API calls (turn_right(), move())
- **wait_for_action()**: Triggered by each API call
- **GUI Controls**: Step/Continue/Pause/Reset/Stop buttons

### Root Cause Analysis
- **State Transition Logic**: Improper STEPPING â†” PAUSED transitions
- **Wait Synchronization**: wait_for_action() state synchronization issues
- **Loop Control**: Python loop control within solve() function problems
- **Missing Functionality**: Reset button completely unimplemented

## Next Steps

1. **Tasks Review**: Review generated tasks.md for implementation completeness and task sizing
2. **Implementation Ready**: All specification phases completed and ready for development
3. **Begin Development**: Execute tasks 1-15 in sequential order following dependencies
4. **Progress Tracking**: Update task completion status as development progresses

## Quality Assurance Planning

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for ExecutionController state transitions
- Integration tests for button functionality
- Performance tests for execution timing
- User experience tests for learning workflow

### Success Metrics
- **Functional**: 100% button functionality correctness
- **Performance**: <50ms button response, <100ms action execution
- **Reliability**: <1% failure rate in 100 consecutive operations
