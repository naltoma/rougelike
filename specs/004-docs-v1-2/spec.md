**Feature Branch**: `004-docs-v1-2`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "docs/v1.2.12.md „ÅÆÂÆüË£Ö„Å´Âêë„Åë„Å¶Ë¶Å‰ª∂ÂÆöÁæ©„Åó„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description extracted from docs/v1.2.12.md
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Players, Items (beneficial/detrimental)
   ‚Üí Actions: Check items, dispose items, pickup items
   ‚Üí Data: HP damage, item types, stage completion
   ‚Üí Constraints: Turn consumption, stage validation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined in v1.2.12 specification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow for item management defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (bomb items, player state)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
   ‚Üí Focus on user requirements and behavior
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a player navigating the rogue-like game stages, I need to be able to identify whether items are beneficial or detrimental before interacting with them, so that I can make strategic decisions about item collection and disposal to complete stages successfully while preserving my health.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a player encounters an item on their current position, **When** they use the item checking operation, **Then** the system returns whether the item is safe to collect or should be avoided
2. **Given** a player is on a tile with a detrimental item, **When** they choose to dispose of the item, **Then** the item is permanently removed from the map and counts toward stage completion requirements
3. **Given** a player picks up a bomb item, **When** the pickup action is completed, **Then** the player's HP is reduced by the specified damage amount (default 100 if not specified)
4. **Given** a stage contains only bomb items that have been disposed of, **When** the player reaches the goal, **Then** the stage completion condition (collect_all_items) is satisfied
5. **Given** a player uses the item checking operation, **When** the check is performed, **Then** no turn is consumed (similar to information gathering operations)
6. **Given** a player uses the disposal operation, **When** the disposal is performed, **Then** one turn is consumed (similar to movement actions)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player tries to dispose an item that doesn't exist on their current tile?
- How does the system handle bomb items with zero or negative damage values?
- What occurs if a player attempts to dispose a beneficial item?
- How does stage completion work when both beneficial and detrimental items are present?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST introduce detrimental items (bombs) that reduce player HP when collected
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide an item checking operation that identifies whether items are safe to collect without consuming turns
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an item disposal operation that removes detrimental items from the map while consuming one turn
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply damage to player HP when bomb items are collected (default 100 damage if damage value not specified)
- **FR-005**: System MUST consider disposed items as satisfying the collect_all_items stage completion condition
- **FR-006**: System MUST update stage generation scripts to include detrimental items as options
- **FR-007**: System MUST update stage validation scripts to handle detrimental items with appropriate avoidance strategies
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve existing main_*.py files without modification (user exercise files)
- **FR-009**: System MUST make new item management operations available through the main API interface
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure item checking operation returns True for beneficial items and False for detrimental items

### Key Entities
- **Bomb Item**: Detrimental item type that causes HP damage when collected, has configurable damage value, can be disposed of instead of collected
- **Player State**: Maintains HP value that can be reduced by detrimental item collection
- **Stage Completion**: Logic that considers both collected beneficial items and disposed detrimental items for completion criteria
